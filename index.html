        <div class="subheading mb-5">Public Policy</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Karine Cuevas. I am a second year Public Policy major, and will potentially also declare a second major in Dance and a minor in Education. With my Public Policy major I have two concentrations in Social, Cultural, and Family Policy, and a second in Environmental and Urban Policy. I am studying at University of California, Riverside. I am involved in a few organizations and departments on campus, and hope to get involved in many many more this following school year. I am a growing scholar hoping to make connections throughout my education here at University of California, Riverside. I also hope to be able to apply my knowledge and degrees here into a career that focuses on the implementation of non-profit organizations and after-school programs and resources in low-income communities of color.<br><br>

        As far as community involvement goes, I am really passionate about my culture and my community. I am a first year general member of Hermanos Unidad. It is part of the Collaborative Multicultural Council here at University of California Riverside. The mission is to increase the retention rate of latino males in higher education through three pillars: social networking, academics, and community service. Over this past year in the organization I have gained a passion for educational studies, and have even taken on the goal of running as Academic Chair, a steering position in the organization, this coming school year in the Fall. I am also involved in a non profit dance company called Versa-Style Dance company under VSPEC, Versa-Style Performance Education Community. Its mission is to provide quality street-dance education to low income communities in the greater Los Angeles area. I have been a member since 2017. In the future I am looking forward to finding more organizations and clubs on and off campus that will enhance my cultural and community connections. Further, I am also currently interning through the Basic Needs Department on Campus, as an R’ Pantry Intern. I have had the position for half a year and have learned a lot about the impacts of food insecurity in higher education through the position, which is highly applicable to my career goals and education in environmental and Social/Cultural Policy.<br><br>

        Looking towards my future career paths, I am considering two paths. Both are concentrated around public policy. The first path I am considering is working with a non profit organization to advocate for arts education, similar to an organization like Versa-Style, or Everybody Dance, an organization I interned for this past summer. I believe that my education in dance studies, as well as my minor in education here at the University of California, Riverside can be highly applicable to my interest in having a career in arts-education, specifically in the education of youth. My second career path interest is focused on tackling food insecurity and food deserts in low-income communities of color. I am currently taking classes on the impacts of water policy and environmental policy on communities of color and how to combat environmental racism in these vulnerable communities.
